# -Flutter-App-API-request-Golang-API-Server
 I implemented a GolangAPI API server which caters to HTTP GET request from client. I created a hypothetical store with products carrying  attributes: Name, Price and Count. A valid HTTP GET  request gets a response with list of products.  In Part-2 of this project, we are going to develop a  Flutter App that will execute API calls to server. The fetched data in JSON format from server will be  displayed in List.
